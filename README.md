## Scenario repository
For seven Hybrid Intelligence scenarios, we provide the task decomposition in markdown as well as a visual (flowchart) representation. The task decomposition consists of a *title*, a *description*, a *visual task decomposition*, *terminology*,  *inference steps* and *tasks*. The HI scenarios currently in the repository are listed below:

- [S1](./Scenarios/S1/) Detecting conflicting, non-cooperative Smart Watch Assistants.
- [S2](./Scenarios/S2/) Learning Explainable Sequential Behaviors.
- [S3](./Scenarios/S3/) Collective Decisions in Law and Economics
- [S4](./Scenarios/S4/) Educational Recommenders with Narratives
- [S5](./Scenarios/S5/) Knowledge Graphs supporting Machine Intelligence
- [S6](./Scenarios/S6/) Co-learning Buildings
- [S7](./Scenarios/S7/) Knowledge-aware Museum Guide for Virtual Heritage Exhibitions

To add a new scenario and task decomposition, clone the repository, add a folder "SX" with a README.md file that uses the same layout as the existing scenarios as well as an image showing the visual task decomposition. Add the scenario through a git pull request.
